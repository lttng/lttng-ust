lttng-ust-dl(3)
===============
:object-type: library


NAME
----
lttng-ust-dl - Dynamic linker tracing (LTTng-UST helper)


SYNOPSIS
--------
Launch your application by preloading `liblttng-ust-dl.so`:

[role="term"]
[verse]
$ *LD_PRELOAD=liblttng-ust-dl.so* my-app


DESCRIPTION
-----------
When the `liblttng-ust-dl.so` library is preloaded before a given
application starts, it causes all calls to man:dlopen(3) and
man:dlclose(3) in said application to be traced with LTTng-UST (see
man:lttng-ust(3)).

See man:lttng(1) to learn more about how to control LTTng tracing
sessions.

IMPORTANT: This LTTng-UST helper can also emit _shared library
load/unload_ events (see _Shared library load/unload tracking_ in
man:lttng-ust(3)). You should :not: use the event records generated by
this LTTng-UST helper (prefixed with `lttng_ust_dl:`) to track the
loading and unloading of shared libraries, especially in situations
where a dynamically loaded library loads its own dependencies. Instead,
do preload `liblttng-ust-dl.so`, but use the shared library load/unload
event records, which are more reliable, for your tracking analysis.

The following LTTng-UST events are available when using this library.


`lttng_ust_dl:dlopen`::
    Emitted when man:dlopen(3) is called.
+
Fields:
+
[options="header"]
|===
|Field name |Description

|`baddr`
|Base address of loaded library.

|`memsz`
|Size of loaded library in memory.

|`flags`
|Flags passed to man:dlopen(3).

|`path`
|Path to loaded library file.

|`has_build_id`
|Whether or not the loaded library has a build ID. If this field is 1,
you can expect that an `lttng_ust_dl:build_id` event record
follows this one (not necessarily immediately after).

|`has_debug_link`
|Whether or not the loaded library has debug link information. If this
field is 1, you can expect that an `lttng_ust_dl:debug_link` event
record follows this one (not necessarily immediately after).
|===

`lttng_ust_dl:dlmopen`::
    Emitted when man:dlmopen(3) is called.
+
Fields:
+
[options="header"]
|===
|Field name |Description

|`baddr`
|Base address of loaded library.

|`memsz`
|Size of loaded library in memory.

|`nsid`
|ID of the namespace in which the library is loaded (as passed
to man:dlmopen(3)).

|`flags`
|Flags passed to man:dlmopen(3).

|`path`
|Path to loaded library file.

|`has_build_id`
|Whether or not the loaded library has a build ID. If this field is 1,
you can expect that an `lttng_ust_dl:build_id` event record
follows this one (not necessarily immediately after).

|`has_debug_link`
|Whether or not the loaded library has debug link information. If this
field is 1, you can expect that an `lttng_ust_dl:debug_link` event
record follows this one (not necessarily immediately after).
|===

`lttng_ust_dl:dlclose`::
    Emitted when man:dlclose(3) is called.
+
Fields:
+
[options="header"]
|===
|Field name |Description

|`baddr`
|Base address of loaded library.
|===

`lttng_ust_dl:debug_link`::
    Emitted when debug link information is found when loading a library
    with man:dlopen(3). See
    https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Separate-Debug-Files.html[Debugging Information in Separate Files]
    for more information about debug links.
+
Fields:
+
[options="header"]
|===
|Field name |Description

|`baddr`
|Base address of loaded library.

|`filename`
|Debug link file name.

|`crc`
|Debug link file's CRC.
|===

`lttng_ust_dl:build_id`::
    Emitted when a build ID is found when loading a library
    with man:dlopen(3). See
    https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Separate-Debug-Files.html[Debugging Information in Separate Files]
    for more information about build IDs.
+
Fields:
+
[options="header"]
|===
|Field name |Description

|`baddr`
|Base address of loaded library.

|`build_id`
|Build ID.
