.
.SH "NAME"
\fBusttrace\fR \-\- the simplest way to record a trace
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBusttrace\fR [\fIoptions\fR] [\fIcommand\fR]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBusttrace\fR script automatically:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
creates a daemon
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
enables all markers
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
runs the command specified on the command line
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
after the command ends, prints the location where the trace was saved
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Each subdirectory of the save location contains the trace of one process that
was generated by the command. The name of a subdirectory consists in the PID of
the process, followed by the timestamp of its creation.
.
.P
The save location also contains logs of the tracing.
.
.P
When using usttrace, the early tracing is always active, which means that the
tracing is guaranteed to be started by the time the process enters its main()
function.
.
.P
Several usttrace's may be run simultaneously without risk of conflict. This
facilitates the use of the tracer by independent users on a system. Each
instance of usttrace starts its own daemon which collects the events of the
processes it creates.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"

starting with two dashes(`\-'). A summary of options is included below.
