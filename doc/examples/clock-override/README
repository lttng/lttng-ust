This clock override example shows how to implement and load a clock
override plugin for LTTng-UST. This can be useful in cases where direct
hardware access is available for architecture-specific clocks, and where
it should be used rather than the Linux kernel Monotonic clock.

When using LTTng-tools keep in mind that lttng-sessiond uses lttng-ust's clock
definition and functions. Thus LTTNG_UST_CLOCK_PLUGIN needs to be defined when
launching lttng-sessiond.
