libmallocwrap is used for instrumenting calls to malloc(3) in a program, without
need for recompiling it.

libmallocwrap defines a malloc() function that is instrumented with a marker. It
also calls the libc malloc afterwards. When loaded with LD_PRELOAD, it replaces
the libc malloc() function, in effect instrumenting all calls to malloc().

See the "run" script for a usage example.
